# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and other relevant factors. Using machine learning techniques, the model helps estimate house prices accurately.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project contains features like:
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Number of bathrooms
  - Square footage
  - Location
  - Year built
  - Other relevant variables
- Data was sourced from [KAGGLE] and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (for machine learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and analysis)

## Model Training
1. Data preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering
   - Scaling and encoding categorical variables
2. Model selection and training:
   - Tried multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest,Decision Tree.
   - Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared


## Results
- The best-performing model achieved an RMSE of [insert value] and an R-squared score of [insert value].
- Feature importance analysis showed that [mention key features] had the most impact on house prices.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:

   https://github.com/LetsoelaAndries/HousePricePred.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script to train and evaluate the model.

## Future Improvements
- Include more features like neighborhood crime rate, school ratings, and local amenities.
- Experiment with deep learning models.
- Deploy the model as a web app for real-time predictions.
